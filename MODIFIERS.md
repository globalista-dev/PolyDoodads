These are all the modifiers for the 1.20.1 version.

Each material has a base modifier and might have a secondary modifier. Gems only have a base modifier and value, with the latter being multiplied by the trinket's material gem modifier. Values with a + are added to the base, while values with an x are multiplied then added to the base.

As an example, a Quartz Iron trinket will grant the player `[base] + 2 Armor`, `[base] + [base] x 0.05 Knockback Resistance`, and `[base] + [base] x 0.05 x 1.5 Movement Speed`.
