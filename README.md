Adding server-side trinkets, it currently features masks, rings, necklaces, anklets and circlets, that can be crafted from copper, iron, gold and netherite. These trinkets also need a cut gem, obtainable by right clicking a grindstone with the desired gem in hand. Each material and gem gives specific buffs to the player.

This mod is fully server-side (provided you use Polymer's generated resource pack on the server) and also works in single player. Recipes can be viewed using Polydex.
